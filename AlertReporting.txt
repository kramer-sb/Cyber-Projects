From TryHackMe SOC Team Internals Room, SOC L1 Alert Reporting: https://tryhackme.com/room/socl1alertreporting
Imagine yourself as an L2 analyst, a DFIR team member, or an IT professional who needs to understand the alert. What would you want to see in the report? We recommend you follow the Five Ws approach and include at least these items in the report:

Who: Which user logs in, runs the command, or downloads the file
What: What exact action or event sequence was performed
When: When exactly did the suspicious activity start and ended
Where: Which device, IP, or website was involved in the alert
Why: The most important W, the reasoning for your final verdict

Create a report using the following information:

Description: The email was classified as phishing post-delivery after an automated analysis. If the email is spoofed or contains any suspicious links or files, it must be deeply investigated.
Subject: Important Update: Microsoft Teams Pricing Increase
Body Keywords: 600% price increase; urgent notice; download the report; read the details;
Sender: Microsoft Support<support@microsoft.com>
Recipient: Eddie Huffman, IT Manager<e.huffman@tryhackme.thm>

At 19:25 UTC an email was determined to be phishing after receipt from support@microsoft.com. Eddie Huffman received the email, on his company approved device. Microsoft support does not send reports in a .rar file, does not typically increase rates by 600%, and communication would not be sent from their support email. This was a phishing attempt.
