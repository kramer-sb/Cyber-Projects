**Cybersecurity Projects / Learnings / Portfolio**

Hi, I'm Brie, and I'm happy you found me here. 

I just yesterday finished the last of three courses with SANS Academy, through a scholarship from Women in Cybersecurity. I began with GIAC Foundational Cybersecurity Technologies (GFACT). then completed GIAC Security Essentials (GSEC), and ended my learning with  GIAC Certified Incident Handler Certification (GCIH). I am now earnestly looking for my very first role in Cybersecurity, and am LONG overdue for creating great portfolio! Everyone tells you to do this, but no one tells you how to find the time to do it while learning all the things, taking care of a family, and finding time to sleep. 

I'm in the top 2% of TryHackMe, but I've documented not much of it, so I thought I'd start there. I'll add other things as I go. Keep checking back! 

**ETA: 12/20/2025**

Found out on December 12 that I have Acinic cell carcinoma (salivary gland cancer), so I am still working on cybersecurity education, but will likely slow down in January as I expect to undergo surgery. In my profile is a notion link where I'm documenting this part of my life's journey if you are interested.
